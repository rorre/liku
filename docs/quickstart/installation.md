# Installation

## Requirements

You will need Python 3.12. This is required because the source code uses new syntax for type parameter ([PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/))

## Install

- Install via git
  ```
  pip install git+https://github.com/rorre/liku.git@main
  ```
- PyPI (soon)
  ```
  pip install liku
  ```

And you are good to go! Continue to [writing your components](components.md)
